**Information for new and experienced CoderDojoTC mentors**

This is a work in progress (3/2015)  Soon it will include:

- Information about CoderDojoTC events -- timing, internet access, loaner laptops, mentor backup, etc.
- Tips on mentoring kids
- Links to information about each code group -- background needed to mentor in that group, how new coders are welcomed, how experienced coders are challenged.
