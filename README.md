**Information for new and experienced CoderDojoTC mentors**


Thank you very much for volunteering to mentor young coders at CoderDojo Twin Cities!

Check out the [CoderDojoTC website](http://www.coderdojotc.org) for lots of useful information including [FAQs for mentors](http://www.coderdojotc.org/faq/#mentoring).  CoderDojo is an international movement of coding clubs for kids;  there's more information on the global organization [here](https://coderdojo.com/).  CoderDojoTC was launched on April 13, 2013 and is one of the largest CoderDojos in the world.  CoderDojoTC has helped inspire 5 other CoderDojos in Minnesota:  Katie CoderDojo, Tonka CoderDojo, SW CoderDojo, Northfield CoderDojo and So MN CoderDojo. 

Here are some [tips on mentoring kids](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/mentor-resources/wiki/Tips-for-Mentoring-Kids).

Here's a wiki page with [information about CoderDojoTC events](https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/mentor-resources/wiki/Info-on-CoderDojoTC-events) -- timing, internet access, loaner laptops, mentor backup, etc. (work in progress)


You can find information about each CoderDojoTC code group by linking to the repositories listed below.  You should also look in the wiki for each code group (link to that inside the code group, from the right hand column.)  Some of the code groups also have information nicely formatted in another website called Read the Docs;  see links below.  

Note:  this is all still a work in progress, so some of the repositories don't yet have much information. Eventually they will all include information about the background needed to mentor in that group, how new coders are welcomed, how experienced coders are challenged, etc.  Want to help with this?   Contact Matt@CoderDojoTC.org or Rebecca@CoderDojoTC.org
